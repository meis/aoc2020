# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020), written in Rust and JavaScript.

To run the code for day XX in Rust:
```bash
cargo run XX [input_file]
```

In JavaScript:
```bash
npm run day XX [input_file]
```

In both cases, `input_file` defaults to `src/dayXX/input`.
